//    In short, the microservice architectural style [1] is an approach to developing a
//    single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and
//    communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services
//    are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated
//    deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these
//    services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different
//    data storage technologies.




//    Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your
//    application. You get a one-stop shop for all the Spring and related technologies that
//    you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy-paste loads of dependency
//    descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for database
//    access, include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in your project.
